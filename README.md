# Regression-Using-PyCaret
Regression Analysis using PyCaret  This Google Colab notebook demonstrates regression modeling using PyCaret, an automated machine learning (AutoML) library. It covers data preprocessing, model training, hyperparameter tuning, and evaluation of multiple regression models.

Regression
Regression is a statistical and machine learning technique used to model the relationship between a dependent variable (target) and one or more independent variables (features). It helps in predicting continuous values based on input data. Some common types of regression include:

-Linear Regression: Establishes a straight-line relationship between variables.
-Multiple Regression: Uses multiple independent variables to predict the target.
-Polynomial Regression: Fits a polynomial equation to the data.
-Logistic Regression: Used for binary classification problems (though it outputs probabilities).
-Ridge & Lasso Regression: Regularized regression techniques to prevent overfitting.
-Regression is widely used in finance, economics, healthcare, and various data-driven applications.


-->Why PyCaret is a Good Option for Regression?
PyCaret simplifies and accelerates the regression workflow with its automated features, making it a great choice for both beginners and experienced data scientists. Here’s why:

✅ 1. Low-Code and Fast Implementation
-Instead of manually writing preprocessing, feature engineering, and model selection code, PyCaret allows you to build a complete regression pipeline with just a few lines.

✅ 2. Automated Feature Engineering & Preprocessing
-Handles missing values automatically.
-Encodes categorical variables without manual intervention.
-Feature scaling & transformation (normalization, standardization) can be applied in one step.
-Outlier detection & removal is built-in.

✅ 3. Model Selection & Comparison
-PyCaret compares multiple regression models in one step and ranks them based on performance metrics like R², RMSE, MAE.
-Supports 20+ regression models, including Linear Regression, Decision Trees, Random Forest, XGBoost, and more.

✅ 4. Automated Hyperparameter Tuning
-PyCaret fine-tunes models with a single command to improve accuracy.

✅ 5. Model Interpretability & Explainability
-PyCaret integrates with SHAP (SHapley Additive Explanations) for feature importance analysis.
-Easily visualize model performance with plots.

✅ 6. Deployment-Ready
-Convert models to API, Docker, or cloud platforms with minimal effort.
